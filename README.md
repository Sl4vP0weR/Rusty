# Rusty

Simple, minimal and lightweight asynchronous "Hello World" application template written in Rust using Tokio.

The Docker image size is ~9MB and is based on Alpine image.

The Docker image builder is based upon a rust image with a slim tag, so it should be lightweight too.

Rust makes me Rusty, and I like it.
